if you choose to add some flair i dont mind as i already am a fan of your work but please let me know ahead of time to make sure its something that falls inline with the feel of the mod 
as always im more than appreciative and i wish i had more to give you but if anyof this is overwhelming let me know as i just want the best mod that can be made with the best people making
it so have fun and i cant wait , meanwhile i will finish the car loot and loot list for the new engines also im going to do some major changes to traders and id like to make a custom prefab pack for this mod 


READ FIRST PLEASE.........

These classes are to be pictured as the job the player had before the outbreak. the starting items are the clothes they had when they got stuck in the shitstorm of the 7 days to die world
and the weapons will be crafted from already existing predecessors they find in the world so a rifle can be turned into a brush gun with magnum and rifle parts and same with the repeater xbow
made from a xbow found from other players or crafted and added other parts so basically these guys can craft there own version of these regular and legendary weapons that are personal to them 
so with that said now as far as beneficial recipes each person has some trick they learned along the way that they use to survive thats unique to them so with that in mind i feel you can see what 
im trying to create. its almost like when you start to play skyrim you have these races and classes that when combined have personal things that make them special. any thoughts please stay in touch
